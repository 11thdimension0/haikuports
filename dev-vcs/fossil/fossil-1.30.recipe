SUMMARY="Simple, high-reliability, distributed software configuration management"
DESCRIPTION="Fossil is a distributed version control system like Git and \
Mercurial, but Fossil also supports distributed bug tracking, \
distributed wiki, and a distributed blog mechanism all in a single \
integrated package.

Additionally, Fossil also has a built-in and easy-to-use web \
interface that simplifies project tracking and promotes situational \
awareness."
