SUMMARY="Simple, high-reliability, distributed software configuration management"
DESCRIPTION="Fossil is a distributed version control system like Git and \
Mercurial, but Fossil also supports distributed bug tracking, wiki, and \
technotes all in a single, integrated package.

Additionally, Fossil also has a built-in and easy-to-use web interface that \
simplifies project tracking and promotes situational awareness."
