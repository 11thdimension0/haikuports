SUMMARY="Open source clone of Theme Hospital"
DESCRIPTION="
CorsixTH aims to reimplement the game engine of Theme Hospital, and be able to
load the original game data files. This means that you will need a purchased
copy of Theme Hospital, or a copy of the demo, in order to use CorsixTH. After
most of the original engine has been reimplemented in open source code, the
project will serve as a base from which extensions and improvements to the
original game can be made.
