SUMMARY="libmicro - portable microbenchmarks"
DESCRIPTION="
LibMicro is a portable set of microbenchmarks that many Solaris
engineers used during Solaris 10 development to measure the
performance of various system and library calls. LibMicro was
developed by Bart Smaalders and Phil Harman as part of their If Linux

Source and uses the CDDL license.The libMicro sources include an awk
script that generates color coded html pages to easily compare
various OS revs, processors and other differences in a quick manner
