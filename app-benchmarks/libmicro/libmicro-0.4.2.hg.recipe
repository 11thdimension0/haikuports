SUMMARY="Portable microbenchmarks"
DESCRIPTION="LibMicro is a portable set of microbenchmarks that many Solaris \
engineers used during Solaris 10 development to measure the performance of \
various system and library calls. LibMicro was developed by Bart Smaalders \
and Phil Harman as part of their If Linux is faster it's a Solaris bug \
performance campaign. LibMicro is Open Source and uses the CDDL license.

The libMicro sources include an awk script that generates color coded html \
pages to easily compare various OS revs, processors and other differences in \
a quick manner."
