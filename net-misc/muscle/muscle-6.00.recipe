DESCRIPTION="The MUSCLE system is a robust, somewhat scalable, cross-platform client-server solution for dynamic distributed applications for Haiku and other operating systems.
	It allows (n) client programs (each of which may be running on a separate computer and/or under a different OS) to communicate with each other in a many-to-many message-passing style.
	It employs a central server to which client programs may connect or disconnect at any time (this design is similar to other client-server systems such as Quake servers, IRC servers, and Napster servers, but more general in application).
	In addition to the client-server system, MUSCLE contains classes to support peer-to-peer message streaming connections, as well as some handy miscellaneous utility classes."
