SUMMARY="A fast compressor/decompressor."
DESCRIPTION="Snappy is a compression/decompression library. It does not aim \
for maximum compression, or compatibility with any other compression library;\
 instead, it aims for very high speeds and reasonable compression. For instance,\
compared to the fastest mode of zlib, Snappy is an order of magnitude faster \
for most inputs, but the resulting compressed files are anywhere from 20% to \
100% bigger.
