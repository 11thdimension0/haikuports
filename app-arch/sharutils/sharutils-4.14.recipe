SUMMARY="sharutils"
DESCRIPTION="
GNU shar makes so-called shell archives out of many files, preparing
them for transmission by electronic mail services. A shell archive is
a collection of files that can be unpacked by /bin/sh. A wide range
of features provide extensive flexibility in manufacturing shars and
in specifying shar smartness. For example, shar may compress files,
uuencode binary files, split long files and construct multi-part
mailings, ensure correct unsharing order, and provide simplistic
checksums.

GNU unshar scans a set of mail messages looking for the start of shell
archives. It will automatically strip off the mail headers and other
introductory text. The archive bodies are then unpacked by a copy of
the shell. unshar may also process files containing concatenated
shell archives.
