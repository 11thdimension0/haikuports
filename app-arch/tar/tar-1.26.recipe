SUMMARY="Saves and restores files to/from a tape or disk archive." 
DESCRIPTION="
	The Tar program provides the ability to create tar archives, as well as 
	various other kinds of manipulation. For example, you can use Tar on 
	previously created archives to extract files, to store additional files, 
	or to update or list files which were already stored.

	Initially, tar archives were used to store files conveniently on magnetic 
	tape. The name "Tar" comes from this use; it stands for tape archiver. 
	Despite the utility's name, Tar can direct its output to available 
	devices, files, or other programs (using pipes), it can even access remote 
	devices or files (as archives).
