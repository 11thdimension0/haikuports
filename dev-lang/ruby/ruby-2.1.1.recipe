SUMMARY="A programming language focused on simplicity and productivity"
DESCRIPTION="
Ruby is a dynamic, reflective, object-oriented, general-purpose
programming language. It was designed and developed in the mid-1990s
by Yukihiro 'Matz' Matsumoto in Japan.

Ruby embodies syntax inspired by Perl with Smalltalk-like features and
was also influenced by Eiffel and Lisp.  It supports multiple
programming paradigms, including functional, object oriented, and
imperative. It also has a dynamic type system and automatic memory
management. Therefore, it is similar in varying degrees to, Smalltalk,
Python, Perl, Lisp, Dylan, and CLU."
