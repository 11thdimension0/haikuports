SUMMARY="An SDL implementation of the popular puzzle game 'Bejeweled'"
DESCRIPTION="
Gemz is an SDL implementation of the popular puzzle game 'Bejeweled'.
The objective of this game is to swap one gem with an adjacent gem to form a \
horizontal or vertical chain of three or more gems. Bonus points are given \
when chains of more than three identical gems are formed and when two chains \
are formed in one swap. Gems disappear when chains are formed and gems fall \
from the top to fill in gaps. Sometimes chain reactions, called cascades, are \
triggered, where chains are formed by the falling gems.
