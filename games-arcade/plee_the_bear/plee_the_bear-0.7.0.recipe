# ----- DESCRIPTION -----------------------------------------------------------

DESCRIPTION="
Plee the Bear is a platform game in which you play an angry bear whose son has
been kidnapped by god. Here is a guy hard to brave! Jump in this amazing journey
to find and rescue your son. Because you want to rescue him, don't you? Or to
slap him? Maybe bothâ€¦.

With three levels of the storyline and four mini-games, Plee the Bear did
received very positive criticisms. The players loved the fun, the graphics and
the music; the community around the free software movement appreciated the
overall process and the quality of the resources, remarkable for a free game;
and the indie gaming community was pleasantly surprised by the technical skills
and the details of the game.
