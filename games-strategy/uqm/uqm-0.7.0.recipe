SUMMARY="a port of Star Control II for modern personal computers and operating systems"
DESCRIPTION="
The project started in August 2002, when Toys For Bob released the partially
ported sources of Star Control 2 3DO version to the fan community. Our goal is
to port this wonderful game to current personal computers and operating systems.
It is and will remain 100% free of charge, and anyone can contribute to the
project and thus help make it even better. For more information, look at our
info page.
