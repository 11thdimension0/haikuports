SUMMARY="Full-strength general purpose cryptography library (with SSL/TLS)"
DESCRIPTION="
	The OpenSSL Project is a collaborative effort to develop a robust, 
	commercial-grade, full-featured, and Open Source toolkit implementing the 
	Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) 
	protocols as well as a full-strength general purpose cryptography library. 
	The project is managed by a worldwide community of volunteers that use the
	Internet to communicate, plan, and develop the OpenSSL toolkit and its 
	related documentation.

	OpenSSL is based on the excellent SSLeay library developed by Eric A. Young
	and Tim J. Hudson. The OpenSSL toolkit is licensed under an Apache-style 
	licence, which basically means that you are free to get and use it for 
	commercial and non-commercial purposes subject to some simple license 
	conditions.
