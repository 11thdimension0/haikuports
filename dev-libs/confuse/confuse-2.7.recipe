SUMMARY="libConfuse - a configuration file parser library"
DESCRIPTION="
libConfuse is a configuration file parser library, licensed under the terms of \
the ISC license, and written in C. It supports sections and (lists of) values \
(strings, integers, floats, booleans or other sections), as well as some other \
features (such as single/double-quoted strings, environment variable expansion, \
functions and nested include statements). It makes it very easy to add \
configuration file capability to a program using a simple API.
The goal of libConfuse is not to be the configuration file parser library with \
a gazillion of features. Instead, it aims to be easy to use and quick to \
integrate with your code. libConfuse was called libcfg before, but its name was \
changed to not confuse itself with other similar libraries.
