DESCRIPTION="
	Libxslt is the XSLT C library developed for the GNOME project. XSLT itself
	is a an XML language to define transformation for XML. Libxslt is based on
	libxml2 the XML C library developed for the GNOME project. It also
	implements most of the EXSLT set of processor-portable extensions functions
	and some of Saxon's evaluate and expressions extensions.

	People can either embed the library in their application or use xsltproc
	the command line processing tool. This library is free software and can be
	reused in commercial applications.
