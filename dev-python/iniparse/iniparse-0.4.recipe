SUMMARY="iniparse is a INI parser for Python"
DESCRIPTION="
iniparse is a INI parser for Python which is:

* Compatiable with ConfigParser: Backward compatible implementations
  of ConfigParser, RawConfigParser, and SafeConfigParser are included
  that are API-compatible with the Python standard library. They pass
  all the unit tests included with Python.

* Preserves structure of INI files: Order of sections & options,
  indentation, comments, and blank lines are preserved as far as
  possible when data is updated.

* More convenient: Values can be accessed using dotted notation
  (cfg.user.name), or using container syntax (cfg['user']['name']).

* It is very useful for config files that are updated both by users
  and by programs, since it is very disorienting for a user to have
  her config file completely rearranged whenever a program changes
  it. iniparse also allows making the order of entries in a config
  file significant, which is desirable in applications like image
  galleries.
