SUMMARY="Fast C library for the Discrete Fourier Transform"
DESCRIPTION="
FFTW is a C subroutine library for computing the discrete Fourier transform \
(DFT) in one or more dimensions, of arbitrary input size, and of both real and \
complex data (as well as of even/odd data, i.e. the discrete cosine/sine \
transforms or DCT/DST). We believe that FFTW, which is free software, should \
become the FFT library of choice for most applications.
Our benchmarks, performed on on a variety of platforms, show that FFTW's \
performance is typically superior to that of other publicly available FFT \
software, and is even competitive with vendor-tuned codes. In contrast to \
vendor-tuned codes, however, FFTW's performance is portable: the same program \
will perform well on most architectures without modification. Hence the name, \
FFTW, which stands for the somewhat whimsical title of Fastest Fourier \
Transform in the West.
