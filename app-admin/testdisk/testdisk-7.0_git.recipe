SUMMARY="Checks and undeletes partitions + PhotoRec, signature based recovery tool"
DESCRIPTION="TestDisk is powerful free data recovery software\! \
It was primarily designed to help recover lost partitions and/or \
make non-booting disks bootable again when these symptoms are caused \
by faulty software: certain types of viruses or human error \
(such as accidentally deleting a Partition Table). \
Partition table recovery using TestDisk is really easy. \

TestDisk can: \

- Fix partition table, recover deleted partition
- Recover FAT32 boot sector from its backup
- Rebuild FAT12/FAT16/FAT32 boot sector
- Fix FAT tables
- Rebuild NTFS boot sector
- Recover NTFS boot sector from its backup
- Fix MFT using MFT mirror
- Locate ext2/ext3/ext4 Backup SuperBlock
- Undelete files from FAT, exFAT, NTFS and ext2 filesystem
- Copy files from deleted FAT, exFAT, NTFS and ext2/ext3/ext4 partitions.

TestDisk has features for both novices and experts. \
For those who know little or nothing about data recovery techniques, \
TestDisk can be used to collect detailed information about a \
non-booting drive which can then be sent to a tech for further analysis. \
Those more familiar with such procedures should find TestDisk a handy \
tool in performing onsite recovery.
