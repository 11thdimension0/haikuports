SUMMARY="libmodplug is a lib for playing mod files"
DESCRIPTION="Olivier Lapicque, author of Modplug, which is arguably the best quality
MOD-playing software available, has placed his sound rendering code in the
public domain.  This library and plugin is based on that code.
- Plays 22 different mod formats, including:
    MOD, S3M, XM, IT, 669, AMF (both of them), AMS, DBM, DMF, DSM, FAR,
    MDL, MED, MTM, OKT, PTM, STM, ULT, UMX, MT2, PSM
- Plays zip, rar, gzip, and bzip2 compressed mods.  The following
    extensions are recognized:
    zip:  MDZ,  S3Z,  XMZ,  ITZ
    rar:  MDR,  S3R,  XMR,  ITR
    gzip: MDGZ, S3GZ, XMGZ, ITGZ
   You can also load plain old ZIP, RAR, and GZ files.  If ModPlug finds
   a mod in them, it will play it.
   Note: To play these formats, you need to have the associated
    decompression utilities (unzip, gunzip, unrar) installed.
   Note(2): The format of the mod is NOT determined from the extension on
    compressed mods.  For example, if you zipped a UMX mod and gave it the
    extension MDZ, it would work fine.
- plays timidity's GUS patch files (*.pat):
   a multi sample pat file with n samples can be played with a Frere Jacques 
   canon with n voices.
- plays all types of MIDI files (*.mid):
   uses the timidity .pat files for samples (when available)"
