DESCRIPTION="
The GIFLIB project maintains the giflib service library, which has been pulling
images out of GIFs since 1989. It is deployed everywhere you can think of and
some places you probably can't - graphics applications and web browsers on
multiple operating systems, game consoles, smartphones, and likely your ATM too.

This is very mature, stable, small-footprint code with minimal dependencies
(suitable for use in embedded deployments) that needs only occasional very
minor bugfixes. Test reports from odd platforms and better regression tests are
particularly welcome. Don't try to redesign it, applications beyond counting
would break if you did.

It's \"GIFLIB\" in caps as a nod to the code's origins in the dark and backward
abysm of MS-DOS, but Unix hackers are encouraged to spell it \"giflib\" in
deference to local conventions. :-)
