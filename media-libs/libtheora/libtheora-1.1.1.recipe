SUMMARY="Theora video compression format library"
DESCRIPTION="
Theora is a free and open video compression format from the Xiph.org \
Foundation. Like all our multimedia technology it can be used to distribute \
film and video online and on disc without the licensing and royalty fees or \
vendor lock-in associated with other formats.
Theora scales from postage stamp to HD resolution, and is considered \
particularly competitive at low bitrates. It is in the same class as \
MPEG-4/DiVX, and like the Vorbis audio codec it has lots of room for \
improvement as encoder technology develops.
Theora is in full public release as of November 3, 2008. The bitstream format \
for Theora I was frozen Thursday, 2004 July 1. All bitstreams encoded since \
that date will remain compatible with future releases.
