SUMMARY="Build tool, replacement for make"
DESCRIPTION="
Jam is a small open-source build tool that can be used as a replacement for \
Make. Even though Jam is a lot simpler to use than Make, it is far more \
powerful and easy to master. Its design is sufficiently clear to allow any \
average programmer to extend it with advanced features at will.
The main differences between Jam and Make are as follows:
- Jam uses ‘Jamfiles’ instead of ‘Makefiles’.
- Jamfiles do not normally contain toolset-specific rules or actions. They are \
thus portable among distinct compilers.
- Jamfiles are a lot simpler than Makefiles to write and understand, while \
providing the same functionality, and much, much more.
