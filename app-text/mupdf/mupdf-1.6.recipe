SUMMARY="A lightweight XPS and PDF rendering library."
DESCRIPTION="
The renderer in MuPDF is tailored for high quality anti-aliased graphics. It \
renders text with metrics and spacing accurate to within fractions of a pixel \
for the highest fidelity in reproducing the look of a printed page on screen.

MuPDF is also small, fast, and yet complete. It supports PDF 1.7 with \
transparency, encryption, hyperlinks, annotations, searching and more. It also \
reads XPS and OpenXPS documents. MuPDF is written modularly, so features can \
be added on by integrators if they so desire.
