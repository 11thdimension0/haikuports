SUMMARY="3D Creation/Animation/Publishing System"
DESCRIPTION="
Blender is the free and open source 3D creation suite. It supports the entirety \
of the 3D pipeline—modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, \
compositing and motion tracking, even video editing and game creation. \
Advanced users employ Blender’s API for Python scripting to customize the \
application and write specialized tools; often these are included in Blender’s \
future releases. Blender is well suited to individuals and small studios who \
benefit from its unified pipeline and responsive development process.
