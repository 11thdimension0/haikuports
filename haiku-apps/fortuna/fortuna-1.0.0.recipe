SUMMARY="A small GUI for showing the well known fortunes"

DESCRIPTION="
	Fortuna is a nice-looking graphical program which displays a fortune when you open it.
	Yeah, sure, there is already a fortune program, but it only shows from the command line,
	you'll get a lot of repeats, it's quite a bit of work to install more,
	and you have to muck around with your UserBootScript. Lots of messing around.
	Then again, you can use Fortuna, which has none of this.
