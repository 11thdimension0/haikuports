SUMMARY="A binary clock application and screensaver"
DESCRIPTION="What Is This:
A Binary Clock.  And yes, you really can use this to tell time!  I
have found it quite enjoyable to reprogram my brain to learn to read
it at a glance.  It just takes a little getting used to.  Detailed
directions on how to read it are included at the end of this file."
