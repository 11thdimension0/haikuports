SUMMARY="Lets you use your Haiku computer from anywhere there is an Internet connection"
DESCRIPTION="A VNC client (available elsewhere for Windows, Mac, Linux, \
others) shows you what's on the remote Haiku computer's screen and sends \
keystrokes and mouse actions over the Internet. The VNCServer software \
running on Haiku uses that client data to simulate button presses on a fake \
keyboard and movements of an imaginary mouse.  n the opposite direction, \
VNCServer scans your screen for changes, compresses the resulting graphics \
data and transmits it to the client.

This is a port of VNC using RealVNC's version 4.0 final source code (which \
has an extremely well designed class structure, making it easy to do this \
port). There are lots of VNC clients out there, but I can recommend the \
RealVNC ones as working very well under Windows.  You can get their clients, \
servers and source code at http://www.realvnc.com/"
