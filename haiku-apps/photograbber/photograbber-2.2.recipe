SUMMARY="An application that downloads/deletes pictures from USB digital cameras"
DESCRIPTION="
The first version of PhotoGrabber was called 'BeCam' and started out as a \
small cli based application which could connect to your camera and download \
the pictures to the computer. It was available for R5 together with the \
experimental USB stack. Although it ran well, it was not that stable due to \
the crappy USB stack. Haiku had no USB stack back then. Over the time you \
could define the place where the pictures should be saved.

'BeCam' grew from a cli application to a GUI app and was able to use all \
default BDCP plugins of 'Exposure!'. After some time the development of \
'BeCam' moved to ZETA. 'BeCam' grew out to become 'BeDiGiCam'and after that \
'PhotoGrabber'. 'PhotoGrabber' was a good name which didn't refer to BeOS. \
Time went by and 'PhotoGrabber'became part of ZETA. Sources where still owned \
by Jixt over the whole period. 'PhotoGrabber' started to use the locale kit \
in ZETA and is since then translated into 14 different languages. After the \
demise of ZETA, Jixt desided to opensource 'PhotoGrabber'. This because he \
had less time to do the development and he didn't want 'PhotoGrabber' to end \
together with ZETA.

As of version 2.x, 'PhotoGrabber' went opensource! Although Jixt had less \
time to develop for it, he rewrote 'PhotoGrabber'. He broke up the \
application into multiple parts (application core, interface, plugins \
and extensions). With this step it was easier for other developers to \
write their own plugins and extensions (add-ons) for the application. \
After he was done with the main parts he opensourced the project and \
attracted a small crew to help out with the developping.
