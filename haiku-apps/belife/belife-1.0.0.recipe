SUMMARY="An app to play the game of life"

DESCRIPTION="
	The Game of Life  is not a game in the conventional sense.
	There are no players, and no winning or losing.
	Once the "pieces" are placed in the starting position,
	the rules determine everything that happens later.
	Nevertheless, Life is full of surprises!
	In most cases, it is impossible to look at a starting position
	(or pattern) and see what will happen in the future.
	The only way to find out is to follow the rules of the game.
