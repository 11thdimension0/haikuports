SUMMARY="The Game of Life."
DESCRIPTION="
The Game of Life  is not a game in the conventional sense. There are no \
players, and no winning or losing. Once the \"pieces\" are placed in the \
starting position, the rules determine everything that happens later. \
Nevertheless, Life is full of surprises! In most cases, it is impossible to \
look at a starting position (or pattern) and see what will happen in the \
future. The only way to find out is to follow the rules of the game.
