DESCRIPTION="The JamMin manages your jamfiles.
Jamfiles are the thing that is most important to the user, bacause
they declare the targets that should be built. Jamfiles are also used
for organizing targetsâ€” each Jamfile is a separate project that can be
built independently from the other projects."
