SUMMARY="The Jamfile Administrator"
DESCRIPTION="
The JamMin manages your jamfiles. Jamfiles are the thing that is most \
important to the user, bacause they declare the targets that should be built. \
Jamfiles are also used for organizing targetsâ€” each Jamfile is a separate \
project that can be built independently from the other projects.
