SUMMARY="An advanced MIDI sequencer"
DESCRIPTION="Sequitur is a BeOS-native MIDI sequencer with a MIDI processing \
add-on architecture. It allows you to record, compose, store, and play back \
music from your computer. Sequitur is designed for people who like to tinker \
with their music. It facilitates rapid, dynamic, and radical processing of your \
performance.

Features:

* An add-on architecture for processing MIDI and performing MIDI effects. \
Change a track's velocity, apply echo, add chorus, change it's key signature, \
etc. All the tools to write your own add-ons are included.
* MIDI processing is integrated with editing: Paint with echo effects, paint \
chords in key, etc.
* Easily rearrange songs with familiar phrase operations.
* Customize your interface with skinning.
* Achieve special effects with tool properties: Turn on gradual delete and \
slowly rub out MIDI events.
* Full support of Be's advanced MIDI services in R5: All R5-compatible \
software is automatically available.
* Record, edit, and playback note, program change, control change, and pitch \
bend MIDI data.
* Read and write standard MIDI files."
