SUMMARY="A powerfull renaming utility"
DESCRIPTION="
PecoRename is a powerfull renaming utility, which allows you to rename many \
files according to a preset pattern.

 * You can rename your files in many different ways:
 * Number your files in order
 * Search and replace
 * Delete characters
 * Make uppercase/lowercase
 * Add the suitable file extension according to the file type
 * Insert, append or replace text...
 
PecoRename gives you an easy to use interface with a powerfull tool behind it.\
The changes can be previewed in realtime.
And - of course - all functions support special chars (like ä, â...).

Whenever you have to rename some or many files the same way, this is YOUR \
program!
