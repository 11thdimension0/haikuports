SUMMARY="A simple note replicant-capable program"
DESCRIPTION="
With DeskNotes, you can now leave little notes all over your desktop \
reminding you of things to do. The main difference between DeskNotes and \
other Note utilities for Haiku, is that DeskNotes is designed to be used \
as a replicant. This means that when you tear a note from the DeskNotes \
application onto your desktop, it stays there! You don't have to save it \
before rebooting, or fiddle with your bootscript.
