SUMMARY="An image viewer/organiser designed for BeOS-compatible operating systems."
DESCRIPTION="Album is a file browsing and tagging utility for BeOS and compatibles. It
started out with a goal of the ultimate image organiser (code named Aberration), but ended
up as something much more modest and BeOS-specific. The idea is to have a work pad for
pictures from different locations where they can be previewed and tagged in one place. The
program is not limited to picture files and BFS (Be File System) volumes, although that
further limits whatever the usefulness since much of the functionality has to do with file
attributes."
