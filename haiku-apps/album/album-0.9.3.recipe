SUMMARY="An image viewer/organiser designed for BeOS-compatible systems"
DESCRIPTION="Album is a file browsing and tagging utility for Haiku. It \
started out with a goal of the ultimate image organiser (code named \
Aberration), but ended up as something much more modest and BeOS-specific. The \
idea is to have a work pad for pictures from different locations where they \
can be previewed and tagged in one place.
The program is not limited to picture files and BFS volumes, although this \
further limits usefulness since much of the functionality has to do with file \
attributes."
