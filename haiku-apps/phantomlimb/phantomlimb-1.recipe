DESCRIPTION="PhantomLimb is a little program to generate tones, and test your discrimination of frequency deltas.  I wrote it for a friend of mine who is suffering from tinnitus ('ringing in the ears') due to an ear infection.  (the infection destroyed some nerve cells in his inner ear, and the lack of signals from the destroyed nerve cells is what causes the ringing--similar to the 'phantom limb'  sensations experienced by amputees.  Hence the name of this program) By practicing discriminating between the sound of the tinnitus and 'nearby' sounds, he hopes to be able to train his brain to discriminate between the 'phantom' sound and other, real sounds."
