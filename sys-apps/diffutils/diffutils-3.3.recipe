SUMMARY="Several programs for finding differences between files."
DESCRIPTION="
You can use the diff command to show differences between two files, or
each corresponding file in two directories. diff outputs differences
between files line by line in any of several formats, selectable by
command line options. This set of differences is often called a ‘diff’
or ‘patch’.

You can use the cmp command to show the offsets and line numbers where
two files differ. cmp can also show all the characters that differ
between the two files, side by side.

You can use the diff3 command to show differences among three files.
When two people have made independent changes to a common original,
diff3 can report the differences between the original and the two
changed versions, and can produce a merged file that contains both
persons' changes together with warnings about conflicts.

You can use the sdiff command to merge two files interactively.
