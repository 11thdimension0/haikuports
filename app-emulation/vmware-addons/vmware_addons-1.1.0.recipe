SUMMARY="Tools for using Haiku in a VMware virtual machine"
DESCRIPTION="
VMware Add-ons are a set of tools to enhance interaction between Haiku, \
running in a virtual machine, and the host operating system. It is like \
the official VMware tools on Windows or Linux.
It currently provides:
 * Clipboard sharing between Haiku and the host OS
 * Mouse sharing: the mouse can seamlessly enter and quit the VM window.
 * Disk compacting: starts the VMware "shrink" process, which reduces the \
 size of "auto-expanding" virtual disks attached to the virtual machine. \
 The free space on disks is cleaned up previously, in order to get better \
 results."
