SUMMARY="The Anonymous Pro Font Family"
DESCRIPTION="
Anonymous Pro is a family of fixed-width fonts. It was designed especially for \
coding - characers that could be mistaken for one another (e. g. O and 0) have \
distinct shapes. It supports most of the Latin-based Western and Central \
European languages, as well as Greek and Cyrillic.
