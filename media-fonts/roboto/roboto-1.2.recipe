SUMMARY="The Android Roboto font."
DESCRIPTION="
	The Android design language relies on traditional typographic tools such as 
	scale, space, rhythm, and alignment with an underlying grid. Successful 
	deployment of these tools is essential to help users quickly understand a 
	screen of information. To support such use of typography, Ice Cream Sandwich
	introduced a new type family named Roboto, created specifically for the 
	requirements of UI and high-resolution screens.
	The current TextView framework offers Roboto in thin, light, regular and 
	bold weights, along with an italic style for each weight. The framework also
	offers the Roboto Condensed variant in regular and bold weights, along with 
	an italic style for each weight.
